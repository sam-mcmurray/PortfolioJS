                                optimization, server-side rendering (SSR), and React’s latest features.

                                can write basic programs, work

                                I have strong experience with NoSQL databases and can effectively use them for
                                unstructured or semi-structured data. I’m
                                comfortable working with key-value stores (e.g., Redis), document-based databases (e.g.,
                                MongoDB), and column-family
                                stores (e.g., Cassandra).

                                I understand when to use NoSQL over traditional relational databases, and I can design
                                scalable and efficient data
                                models based on the specific database type. I’m familiar with concepts like sharding,
                                replication, and eventual
                                consistency, and have experience in integrating NoSQL databases into applications for
                                high-performance and large-scale
                                systems.

                                While proficient, I’m still refining my expertise in advanced NoSQL topics like data
                                modeling for large-scale
                                applications, consistency patterns, and integrating NoSQL with other data systems.

                    <div class="des">Our project is an outdoor app where you can search for hikes and other outdoor
                        activities such
                        as fishing and hunting. You can rate trails and share with others. You can connect and chat
                        with
                        others who might have went on the hike you are about to go on. In the app you can follow
                        people, view profiles.
                        We used Anroid for the frontend UI and Firebase as out database for the user and the
                        activities.
                        The project also uses services such as google maps.
